# tracing-profile

This library implements subscribers for the [`tracing`](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/) crate that facilitate
profiling of one-shot program executions. That is, this is not intended for profiling of long-running programs.

`tracing-profile` depends on [`tracing-subscriber`](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/) and
implements layers that measure, record, and display timing information in the span graph. The implemented
`tracing_subscriber::Layer` records the time a span took to execute, along with any user supplied metadata and
information necessary to construct a span graph from the resulting logs.

Note that if `#[tracing::instrument]` is used, the `skip_all` argument is recommended. Omitting this will result in all
the function arguments being included as fields.

## Usage

The library exposes several layers that output the information in different ways.

## Feature flags
 - `perf_counters` enables `PrintPerfCountersLayer` layer. Currently performance counters work for Linux only.

### PrintTreeLayer

The `PrintTreeLayer` processes the profiling information in the running process and prints the timing information in a
human-readable format. The output structures the span graph as a tree.

```
$ cargo test -- --nocapture
root span [ 112.67µs | 100.00% ]
├── child span1 [ 2.63µs | 2.33% ] { field1 = value1 }
└── child span2 [ 64.29µs | 57.06% ] { field2 = value2 }
   ├── child span3 [ 1.88µs | 1.66% ] { field3 = value3 }
   └── child span4 [ 1.67µs | 1.48% ] { field4 = value4 }
```

### PrintPerfCountersLayer

The `PrintPerfCountersLayer` at the construction receives a vector of events (`perf_event::events::Event`) and their names. During execution for each span the number of the given events of each type is summed. The results are printed to the standard output in a form of a table.

`perf_counters` crate feature enables this functionality.


```
$ cargo test -- --nocapture
child span4:
    instructions: 44142
    cycles: 34398
child span3:
    instructions: 44132
    cycles: 37674
child span2:
    instructions: 282256
    cycles: 272064
child span1:
    instructions: 49107
    cycles: 112554
root span:
    instructions: 661552
    cycles: 738894
```

### IttApiLayer

The `IttApiLayer` adds one `ittapi::Task` for each span at runtime allowing observing spans in Intel VTune profiler. See [ITT API documentation](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/vtune-profiler/user-guide/2023-1/instrumentation-and-tracing-technology-apis.html) for reference.

`ittapi` crate feature enables this functionality.

### Perfetto layer

The `Perfetto` layer
 - for each tracing span span creates a single Perfetto event with the same lifetime
 - for each event that has `counter` property set to true updates the corresponding Perfetto counter value using the `value` property of the event.

See the documentation to the `PerfettoLayer` struct for more details.

_Perfetto is supported only if the target OS is Linux._

### Example Test

```rust
fn make_spans() {
    let span = debug_span!("root span");
    let _scope1 = span.enter();

    // child spans 1 and 2 are siblings
    let span2 = debug_span!("child span1", field1 = "value1");
    let scope2 = span2.enter();
    drop(scope2);

    let span3 = debug_span!("child span2", field2 = "value2");
    let _scope3 = span3.enter();

    // child spans 3 and 4 are siblings
    let span = debug_span!("child span3", field3 = "value3");
    let scope = span.enter();
    drop(scope);

    let span = debug_span!("child span4", field4 = "value4");
    let scope = span.enter();
    drop(scope);
}

#[test]
fn all_layers() {
    tracing_subscriber::registry()
        .with(PrintTreeLayer::default())
        .init();
    make_spans();
}
```

### Configuration

Using `PrintTreeConfig` you can configure color and aggregation/hiding thresholds.

```rs
#[test]
fn all_layers() {
    tracing_subscriber::registry()
        .with(PrintTreeLayer::new(PrintTreeConfig {
            attention_above_percent: 25.0,
            relevant_above_percent: 2.5,
            hide_below_percent: 1.0,
            display_unaccounted: false
        }))
        .init();
    make_spans();
}
```
